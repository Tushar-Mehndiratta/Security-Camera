This project entitled as "Smart Security Camera" can be used for detecting any motion or presence of human activity in front of camera.
For Simplification and demonstration purpose a webcam is used, but for real life scenarios it can be implemented with other cameras' like CCTV, etc.
Here in this project python programming language is being used with the help of OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) Library.
This python code would send the user an e-mail with the invader's face picture attached to it, as soon as someone is detected in front of the camera.
As soon as the user presses 'q' button on the keyboard, it would stop execution of the code.

Haar Cascade
Haar-based cascade classifier, is a very effective object detection method.
It is a machine learning approach that consists on training the algorithm from a lot of positive and negative images.

That is what we will be using here in this project.
There are tons of different Haar Cascades already trained for developers, so we actually don't have to go through all this trouble.
For this particular case, I am going to use a face-detector Haar Cascade Classifier.

Note:- Make Sure all the files are present in same folder including the "haarcascade_frontalface_alt2.xml" file.
